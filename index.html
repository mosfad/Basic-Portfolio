            <p>I am a software development enthusiast and a stay-at-home dad. I have two wonderful children whom I enjoy nuturing and caring for.   </p>
            <p>My background is in electrical engineering, which I studied at the University of Houston. After graduating with a bachelor's degree in 2007, I worked as a design engineer with Houston Transformer Company for a couple of years.</p>
            <p>Being an elder millenial, I have different hobbies and interests. For example, I am curious about the technologies that power social media platforms, but I am not active on their websites. I also enjoy playing basketball, watching great shows such as Game of Thrones and spending a lazy afternoon with my wife and kids at the beach.</p>
